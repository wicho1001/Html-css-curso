    <h2>November 24, 1995</h2>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was published as IETF RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added
        capabilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
        <li> May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
        <li> August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
        <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> January 14, 1997</h2>
    <p>HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
        version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the
        IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</p>
        <p> Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
            reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted
            most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and
            Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement
            between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar
            to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>

    <h2>  December 18, 1997</h2>
    <p> HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three
        variations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
            <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
            <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific
        element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out
        Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in
        favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO
        8879 – SGML.</p>
    <h2>April 24, 1998</h2>
    <p>HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version
        number.</p>
    <h2>December 24, 1999</h2>
    <p>HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same
        three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on
        May 12, 2001.</p>
    <h2> May 2000</h2>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was
        published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this
        standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint
        Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and
        processing languages).</p>
        <p>       After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as
        development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the
        W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</p>
    <h2>October 28, 2014</h2>
    <p>HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
    <h2>November 1, 2016</h2>
    <p> HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
