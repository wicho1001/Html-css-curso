    HTML versions timeline

    November 24, 1995

    HTML 2.0 was published as IETF RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added
    capabilities:

    November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
    May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
    August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
    January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)

    January 14, 1997

    HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
    version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the
    IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.

    Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
    reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted
    most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and
    Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement
    between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar
    to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.

    December 18, 1997

    HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three
    variations:

    Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
    Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
    Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.

    Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific
    element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out
    Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in
    favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO
    8879 – SGML.

    April 24, 1998

    HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version
    number.

    December 24, 1999

    HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same
    three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on
    May 12, 2001.

    May 2000

    ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was
    published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this
    standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint
    Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and
    processing languages).

    After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as
    development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the
    W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.

    October 28, 2014
    HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.

    November 1, 2016
    HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
